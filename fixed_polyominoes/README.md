# Count Fixed Polyominoes
This assignment calculates the number of fixed polyominoes for each possible set of n squares. A polyomino is a geometric shape consisting of a number of squares, each two of which share a common side. Polyominoes can be free or fixed - free if we do not allow rotations and symmetries and fixed otherwise.
